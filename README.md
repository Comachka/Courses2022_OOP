1. Create an abstract class for game world characters or units (Unit). Describe three properties of the units. Define a basic movement method that is common to all units, and one abstract method. Add interfaces for unit skills. For example, a unit can jump, swim, or fly. At least three skills are required. Create child classes that inherit from the abstract Unit class and implement their skills.

2. Develop a class that describes a unique exception for your application. (Methods in our application throw an exception when an empty string is passed as a string argument.) Create a class in which the previously developed exception is called. In the Program class, implement exception handling in such a way that the corresponding message is displayed depending on the caught exception. Create a situation where the previously developed exception is handled.

3. Develop a library class that contains a set of books of different genres. Create a reader class that waits for a favorite genre book to arrive in the library (there are readers who like several genres at once).
